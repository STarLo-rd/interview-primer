**1. The Light Bulb Switches Problem**

_Problem:_

You are in a room with three light switches. Each switch controls one of three light bulbs in the adjacent room, but you don't know which switch corresponds to which bulb. You can manipulate the switches as much as you want, but you may only enter the room with the bulbs once. How can you determine which switch controls which bulb?

_Solution:_

1. Turn on the first switch and leave it on for about 10 minutes.
2. After 10 minutes, turn off the first switch and immediately turn on the second switch.
3. Now, enter the room with the bulbs.

- The bulb that is on corresponds to the second switch (since it's currently receiving power).
- The bulb that is off but warm corresponds to the first switch (it was on long enough to heat up and was turned off just before entering the room).
- The bulb that is off and cold corresponds to the third switch (it was never turned on).

**2. The Two Ropes Burning Problem**

_Problem:_

You have two ropes of varying thicknesses and materials. Each rope takes exactly one hour to burn from one end to the other. However, the ropes do not burn at a uniform rate; for example, half the rope could burn in 5 minutes, and the remaining half could take 55 minutes. With these two ropes and a way to light them, how can you measure exactly 45 minutes?

_Solution:_

1. Light both ends of the first rope simultaneously and one end of the second rope at the same time.
2. The first rope will take 30 minutes to burn completely when lit from both ends.
3. At the moment the first rope finishes burning (which is 30 minutes in), light the other end of the second rope.
4. Since the second rope has been burning from one end for 30 minutes, it has 30 minutes of burn time left. Lighting the other end will cause it to burn in half the time, which is 15 minutes.

By adding the 30 minutes from the first rope and the 15 minutes from the second rope, you get a total of 45 minutes.

**3. The Heaven or Hell Door Problem**

_Problem:_

You stand before two doors. One leads to Heaven, and the other leads to Hell. Two guardians are present: one always tells the truth, and the other always lies. You don't know which guardian is which, and you can ask only one question to one of the guardians to determine the door to Heaven. What question do you ask?

_Solution:_

Ask either guardian: "If I were to ask the other guardian which door leads to Heaven, which door would they point to?"

- If you ask the truth-telling guardian, they will truthfully tell you that the other (lying) guardian would point to the Hell door.
- If you ask the lying guardian, they will lie about the truth-teller's response, also pointing to the Hell door.

In both cases, the guardian will indicate the door to Hell. Therefore, you should choose the opposite door to find Heaven.

**4. The Three Boxes Problem**

_Problem:_

You have three boxes: one contains only apples, one contains only oranges, and the third contains both apples and oranges. Each box is labeled, but all labels are incorrect. You are allowed to pick one fruit from one box. How can you label all the boxes correctly?

_Solution:_

1. Choose a fruit from the box labeled "Apples and Oranges." Since all labels are incorrect, this box must contain only apples or only oranges.
2. Suppose you pick an apple. This means the box labeled "Apples and Oranges" contains only apples.
3. The box labeled "Oranges" cannot contain oranges (since its label is incorrect) and cannot contain apples (since we've determined the "Apples and Oranges" box contains only apples). Therefore, it must contain both apples and oranges.
4. The remaining box, labeled "Apples," must contain only oranges.

If you had picked an orange in step 2, the logic would similarly lead you to correctly label all the boxes.

**5. The Monty Hall Problem**

_Problem:_

You're on a game show with three doors. Behind one door is a car; behind the other two are goats. You pick one door. The host, who knows what's behind each door, opens another door, revealing a goat. He then asks if you want to switch your choice to the remaining door or stay with your original choice. What should you do to maximize your chances of winning the car?

_Solution:_

You should switch doors.

When you make your initial choice, there's a 1/3 chance you've picked the car and a 2/3 chance you've picked a goat. When the host reveals a goat behind one of the other two doors, the 2/3 probability doesn't split between the two remaining doors; instead, it remains with the unchosen door. Therefore, switching gives you a 2/3 chance of winning the car, while staying gives you only a 1/3 chance.

These problems are classic examples used to assess logical reasoning and problem-solving skills in technical interviews. Practicing such questions can help you develop a structured approach to tackling complex scenarios, which is invaluable in a backend development role.

**6. The 12 Balls Problem:**

_Problem:_ You have 12 visually identical balls, but one differs in weight (it could be heavier or lighter). Using a balance scale and only three weighings, determine which ball is different and whether it is heavier or lighter.

_Approach:_ Divide the balls into three groups of four. Weigh two groups against each other:

- If they balance, the odd ball is in the third group.
- If they don't, the odd ball is in the heavier or lighter group.

Continue this process, narrowing down the possibilities with each weighing, until you identify the unique ball and its weight difference.

**7. Bridge and Torch Problem:**

_Problem:_ Four people need to cross a bridge at night. They have one torch, and the bridge can hold only two people at a time. Each person walks at a different speed: 1, 2, 5, and 10 minutes respectively. When two people cross together, they move at the slower person's pace. What is the minimum time required for all to cross?

_Approach:_ The optimal strategy involves minimizing the time spent by the two slowest individuals:

1. Person 1 and Person 2 cross (2 minutes).
2. Person 1 returns (1 minute).
3. Person 5 and Person 10 cross (10 minutes).
4. Person 2 returns (2 minutes).
5. Person 1 and Person 2 cross again (2 minutes).

Total time: 2 + 1 + 10 + 2 + 2 = 17 minutes.

**8. Inverted Cards Puzzle:**

_Problem:_ You have 52 cards face down. Exactly 10 of them are face up. You are blindfolded and can flip any cards. How can you split the deck into two piles so that each pile has the same number of face-up cards?

_Approach:_ Divide the deck into two piles of 10 and 42 cards. Flip all the cards in the 10-card pile. Both piles will now have the same number of face-up cards.

These puzzles are designed to assess your logical reasoning and problem-solving skills, which are crucial in software engineering roles. Practicing such questions can enhance your analytical thinking and prepare you for similar challenges in interviews.

### **1. The Two Egg Problem**

**Problem Statement:**  
You have two identical eggs and access to a 100-story building. The eggs may break if dropped from certain floors, and they may not. Both eggs have the same breaking threshold. Your task is to determine the highest floor from which you can drop an egg without it breaking, using the fewest number of drops possible.

**Answer:**  
The key is to minimize the worst-case number of drops. A binary search-like approach is inefficient since breaking an egg at a high floor would leave you testing one floor at a time from the lowest level. Instead, use a mathematical approach:

1. Drop the first egg from floors in increasing increments (e.g., 14th, 27th, 39th, etc.).
2. If it breaks, use the second egg to test the floors sequentially below it.
3. The optimal strategy is to drop the first egg at intervals of _x, x-1, x-2, …, 1_ such that the sum is at least 100. Solving for _x_, we get _x = 14_.

Thus, the first egg is dropped from floors: **14, 27, 39, 50, 60, 69, 77, 84, 90, 95, 99**. If it breaks at a certain floor, the second egg is used to search linearly from the last safe floor. This ensures a worst-case of **14 drops**.

### **2. The Poisonous Wine Problem**

**Problem Statement:**  
You have 1,000 bottles of wine, and one of them is poisoned. You also have 10 prisoners available for testing. The poison is such that if a prisoner drinks it, they will die within 24 hours. How can you identify the poisoned bottle within 24 hours using the prisoners as test subjects?

**Answer:**  
Think of the 1,000 bottles as a **binary number problem**:

1. Number each bottle from **1 to 1000** in binary (e.g., Bottle 1 = 0000000001, Bottle 2 = 0000000010, …, Bottle 1000 = 1111101000).
2. Assign each prisoner a binary digit position (bit position 1 to 10).
3. If a bottle has a `1` in a given bit position, the corresponding prisoner drinks from it.
4. After 24 hours, the combination of dead prisoners forms a unique 10-bit binary number, which directly maps to the poisoned bottle.

Since **10 bits allow us to encode up to 2¹⁰ = 1024 possibilities**, this method efficiently finds the poisoned bottle with just one round of testing.

### **3. The Measuring Water Puzzle**

**Problem Statement:**  
You have two unmarked jugs: one with a capacity of 3 liters and the other with a capacity of 5 liters. How can you measure exactly 4 liters of water using these two jugs?

**Answer:**

1. Fill the 5L jug completely.
2. Pour water from the 5L jug into the 3L jug until it is full (leaving 2L in the 5L jug).
3. Empty the 3L jug.
4. Pour the 2L from the 5L jug into the empty 3L jug.
5. Fill the 5L jug again.
6. Pour water from the 5L jug into the 3L jug until it is full. Since the 3L jug already had 2L, it will take only 1 more liter, leaving **exactly 4L in the 5L jug**.

### **4. The Blue Eyes Puzzle**

**Problem Statement:**  
On an island, there are 100 inhabitants with blue eyes and 100 with brown eyes. They are unaware of their own eye color but can see the eye color of others. If an individual discovers they have blue eyes, they must leave the island at midnight. One day, a visitor announces that at least one person on the island has blue eyes. What happens over time?

**Answer:**

1. Each blue-eyed person sees **99** others with blue eyes.
2. Since they don’t know their own color, they expect that if they don’t have blue eyes, those 99 should leave after 99 nights.
3. When that doesn’t happen, they all realize they also have blue eyes and leave on **night 100**.

Thus, all **100 blue-eyed people leave together on the 100th night**.

### **5. The Five Pirates Problem**

**Problem Statement:**  
Five pirates have 100 gold coins to divide among themselves. They decide on a distribution method: the most senior pirate proposes a distribution, and all pirates (including the proposer) vote on it. If at least half agree, the coins are distributed accordingly. If not, the proposer is thrown overboard, and the process repeats with the next most senior pirate. What distribution should the most senior pirate propose to maximize their share while ensuring their survival?

**Answer:**  
Work backward from the simplest case:

1. **If only one pirate remains (P5)**, he takes **all 100 coins**.
2. **If two pirates remain (P4, P5)**, P4 takes **all 100** since P5 has no vote.
3. **If three pirates remain (P3, P4, P5)**, P3 offers **1 coin to P5** to gain his vote (keeping 99).
4. **If four pirates remain (P2, P3, P4, P5)**, P2 offers **1 coin to P4** and **2 coins to P5**, keeping 97.
5. **If all five pirates are present (P1, P2, P3, P4, P5)**, P1 must bribe two pirates:
   - **P3 gets 1 coin**
   - **P5 gets 2 coins**
   - **P1 keeps 97 coins**

Since P3 and P5 vote in favor (securing a 3/5 majority), P1 survives while taking **97 coins**.

# common explanation

The most efficient strategy for the Two Egg Problem involves a systematic approach that minimizes the worst-case number of drops. Here's a detailed explanation of the strategy and its rationale:

**The Two Egg Problem:**

You have two identical eggs and access to a 100-story building. The eggs may break if dropped from certain floors, and they may not. Both eggs have the same breaking threshold. Your task is to determine the highest floor from which you can drop an egg without it breaking, using the fewest number of drops possible.

1. **Determine the Drop Floors for the First Egg:**

   - Instead of dropping the first egg at equal intervals (like every 10 floors), we drop it from floors that decrease the interval by 1 each time. This way, if the egg breaks at a high floor, the number of floors you need to check with the second egg is minimized.
   - Let the first drop be at floor **x**. Then, if it doesn't break, the next drop should be at floor **x + (x - 1)**, then **x + (x - 1) + (x - 2)**, and so on.

2. **Ensure Full Coverage:**

   - The idea is to cover all 100 floors such that in the worst-case scenario, the total number of drops (first egg drops + second egg drops) is the same regardless of which drop the egg first breaks.
   - Mathematically, we want:

     \[
     x + (x-1) + (x-2) + \dots + 1 \geq 100
     \]

   - The sum of the first \( x \) natural numbers is given by:

     \[
     \frac{x(x+1)}{2}
     \]

   - We need:

     \[
     \frac{x(x+1)}{2} \geq 100
     \]

   - Testing values, we find:

     - For \( x = 13 \): \(\frac{13 \times 14}{2} = 91\) (which is less than 100)
     - For \( x = 14 \): \(\frac{14 \times 15}{2} = 105\) (which is greater than or equal to 100)

   - Thus, **x = 14** is the smallest number that meets the condition.

---

### **Executing the Strategy:**

- **Drop 1:** Drop the first egg from floor **14**.
  - **If it breaks:** You have to check floors 1 through 13 sequentially with the second egg. In the worst case, you will make 14 drops (1 drop from floor 14 and up to 13 drops with the second egg).
- **Drop 2:** If the egg survives, drop it from floor **14 + 13 = 27**.
  - **If it breaks:** Check floors **15 to 26** sequentially with the second egg. Total drops in worst case: 2 (first egg) + up to 12 (second egg) = 14.
- **Drop 3:** If it still survives, drop it from floor **27 + 12 = 39**.
  - **If it breaks:** Check floors **28 to 38** sequentially. Total drops: 3 + up to 11 = 14.
- Continue in this manner:
  - Next drop: **39 + 11 = 50**
  - Then: **50 + 10 = 60**
  - Then: **60 + 9 = 69**
  - Then: **69 + 8 = 77**
  - Then: **77 + 7 = 84**
  - Then: **84 + 6 = 90**
  - Then: **90 + 5 = 95**
  - Finally: **95 + 4 = 99** (and adjust for the final floors as needed to cover all 100 floors)

Even though the exact floors might be adjusted slightly to cover exactly 100 floors, the worst-case number of drops will never exceed **14**.

**The Poisonous Wine Problem:**

You have 1,000 bottles of wine, and one of them is poisoned. You also have 10 prisoners available for testing. The poison is such that if a prisoner drinks it, they will die within 24 hours. How can you identify the poisoned bottle within 24 hours using the prisoners as test subjects?

### **Step 1: Label the Bottles**

- Number the bottles from **0** to **999**.
- Each bottle number can be represented in binary. Since \(2^{10} = 1024\) is greater than 1000, you can use a 10-bit binary number for each bottle.

---

### **Step 2: Assign Prisoners to Binary Digits**

- Label the 10 prisoners as **Prisoner 1** through **Prisoner 10**. Each prisoner will correspond to one of the 10 bits in the binary representation.
  - For example, **Prisoner 1** corresponds to the least significant bit (bit 1), **Prisoner 2** to bit 2, and so on up to **Prisoner 10** (most significant bit).

---

### **Step 3: Design the Testing Scheme**

- For each bottle, look at its binary representation.
- **If a bit is 1**, have the corresponding prisoner taste that bottle. For example:

  - Suppose bottle number 537 has a binary representation of `1000011001`.
  - This means:
    - **Prisoner 10** (for the first bit from the left, if we assume the most significant bit is Prisoner 10) drinks from bottle 537.
    - **Prisoner 6** drinks (since the sixth bit from the left is 1).
    - **Prisoner 3** drinks.
    - **Prisoner 1** drinks.
  - All other prisoners do not drink from that bottle.

- **Repeat this for every bottle.** A prisoner might drink from several bottles, but that’s okay.

---

### **Step 4: Observe the Results After 24 Hours**

- After 24 hours, note which prisoners have died.
- Construct a 10-bit binary number where each bit represents a prisoner:

  - A bit is **1** if the corresponding prisoner died.
  - A bit is **0** if the prisoner survived.

- The resulting binary number will directly correspond to the number of the poisoned bottle.

  **For example:**

  - If only **Prisoner 1, Prisoner 3, Prisoner 6, and Prisoner 10** died, you would construct the binary number with 1s in those positions.
  - Interpreting that binary number will give you the exact bottle number that is poisoned.

---

### **Conclusion**

By assigning each bottle a unique 10-bit binary number and having each prisoner drink from bottles corresponding to the bits set to 1 in that number, the pattern of deaths among the prisoners directly reveals the binary number (and hence the label) of the poisoned bottle. This efficient method ensures that you can identify the poisoned bottle within 24 hours using only 10 prisoners.

**9. The Poisonous Wine Problem:**

On an island, there are 100 inhabitants with blue eyes and 100 with brown eyes. They are unaware of their own eye color but can see the eye color of others. If an individual discovers they have blue eyes, they must leave the island at midnight. One day, a visitor announces that at least one person on the island has blue eyes. What happens over time?

### **The Setup**

- **Population:**
  - 100 inhabitants have blue eyes.
  - 100 inhabitants have brown eyes.
- **Rules:**
  - No one knows their own eye color, but they can see everyone else's.
  - If an individual deduces that they have blue eyes, they must leave the island at midnight that day.
  - Communication about eye color is forbidden.
- **The Visitor's Statement:**  
  One day, a visitor publicly announces, "At least one person on this island has blue eyes." Although everyone already sees many blue-eyed people, this statement creates a piece of _common knowledge_—everyone now knows that everyone knows (and so on) that there is at least one blue-eyed person.

---

### **The Inductive Reasoning Process**

The reasoning starts with simpler cases and then builds up:

1. **Case 1: If There Were Only 1 Blue-Eyed Person**

   - That person would see no one with blue eyes.
   - The visitor's statement implies that there must be at least one blue-eyed person, so the lone blue-eyed person would realize, "It must be me!"
   - Consequently, they would leave on the **first night**.

2. **Case 2: If There Were 2 Blue-Eyed People**

   - Each blue-eyed person sees 1 blue-eyed individual.
   - They might think: "If I have brown eyes, then that person I see is the only one with blue eyes, and they would have left on the first night."
   - When neither leaves on the first night, both deduce that they must also have blue eyes.
   - Therefore, both leave on the **second night**.

3. **General Case: \(n\) Blue-Eyed People**
   - Each blue-eyed person sees \(n-1\) others with blue eyes.
   - They reason: "If I have brown eyes, then those \(n-1\) people would have left on the \((n-1)\)th night."
   - When that day passes and no one leaves, each blue-eyed person concludes, "I must also have blue eyes."
   - All \(n\) blue-eyed inhabitants then leave on the **\(n\)th night**.

---

### **Application to Our Puzzle**

- **In Our Case:**  
  There are 100 blue-eyed people.
- **Inductive Conclusion:**  
  Each blue-eyed inhabitant sees 99 others with blue eyes. They all wait, expecting that if there were only 99 blue-eyed individuals, those 99 would leave on the 99th night.
- **The Key Moment:**  
  When the 99th night passes without any blue-eyed person leaving, every blue-eyed inhabitant realizes that they too must have blue eyes.
- **Outcome:**  
  On the **100th night**, all 100 blue-eyed inhabitants leave the island simultaneously.

The brown-eyed inhabitants, having never received any indication regarding their own eye color (and not being affected by this chain of reasoning), remain on the island.
