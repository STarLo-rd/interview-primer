The **MERN stack** is a combination of four technologies:  
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format.  
- **Express.js**: A lightweight framework for building server-side applications in Node.js.  
- **React**: A powerful frontend library for building user interfaces using components.  
- **Node.js**: A runtime environment for executing JavaScript code server-side.

### Why choose MERN for a project?
- **Full JavaScript Stack**: It allows developers to use a single programming language (JavaScript) across the entire stack—frontend, backend, and database queries—reducing context switching.
- **Flexibility**: Each component can be scaled and customized independently, making it suitable for a wide range of projects.
- **Open Source Ecosystem**: The MERN stack has a vibrant, open-source community that provides robust libraries and tools, accelerating development.
- **Efficient Data Flow**: React’s unidirectional data flow, combined with Node.js and MongoDB, provides seamless integration for modern web apps.
