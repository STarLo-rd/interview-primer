### **Role of Each Component in MERN:**

1. **MongoDB**:  
   - Acts as the database layer, storing data in a NoSQL format using JSON-like documents.  
   - Provides flexibility in schema design, making it ideal for applications with rapidly changing requirements.  
   - Integrates seamlessly with Node.js using libraries like Mongoose for schema validation and data querying.

2. **Express.js**:  
   - A minimalist web framework for Node.js that simplifies the creation of APIs and web servers.  
   - Helps handle routing, middleware, and HTTP methods efficiently.  
   - Enables clean separation of application logic and request handling.

3. **React**:  
   - A frontend library for building dynamic, high-performance user interfaces.  
   - Uses a component-based architecture and virtual DOM for fast rendering.  
   - Facilitates the creation of scalable applications through reusable components and unidirectional data flow.

4. **Node.js**:  
   - Serves as the runtime environment for JavaScript, enabling server-side execution of code.  
   - Utilizes a non-blocking, event-driven architecture, making it ideal for building high-performance, scalable applications.  
   - Acts as the backend layer, processing client requests and communicating with MongoDB.

### **Communication Between Components:**
- **Frontend to Backend**: React sends HTTP requests (via `fetch` or `axios`) to the backend server (Node.js/Express) to interact with APIs.  
- **Backend to Database**: Express handles API requests and communicates with MongoDB to perform CRUD operations using libraries like Mongoose.  
- **Response to Frontend**: MongoDB provides data to Express, which processes and sends the response back to React.
