### **`useEffect` vs `useLayoutEffect`**

Both `useEffect` and `useLayoutEffect` are hooks that are used to perform side effects in functional components. They are very similar, but they differ in **timing** and **when** they run in the rendering lifecycle.

### **`useEffect`**:

- **Purpose**: Used for handling side effects that do not block the painting of the DOM. This is typically used for tasks like data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM after rendering.
- **When it runs**:
  - Runs **after** the paint (rendering) is committed to the screen.
  - This means that the UI is painted first, and then `useEffect` runs, making it a good choice for non-blocking tasks.
- **Typical Use Cases**:
  - **Data fetching**: Fetching data from an API or other asynchronous tasks.
  - **Event listeners**: Setting up or cleaning up event listeners, subscriptions, or other side effects.
  - **DOM mutations**: Interacting with the DOM after the render, like focusing an input field.
- **Performance**: Since it runs after the paint, it won’t block the user interface and can be less disruptive to the user experience.

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  // Example: Fetch data after render
  fetchData();
}, []); // Empty dependency array means this runs only once after the initial render
```

### **`useLayoutEffect`**:

- **Purpose**: Used for side effects that **must** be executed synchronously **before** the DOM is painted to the screen. This is typically used for tasks that might affect the layout or visual appearance of the page, such as reading or changing the layout, measurements, or DOM properties before the screen is painted.
- **When it runs**:
  - Runs **before** the paint, after all DOM mutations but before the screen is rendered.
  - This ensures that any changes to the layout are applied before the user sees the updated UI.
- **Typical Use Cases**:
  - **Layout measurement**: Measuring elements' size or position (like `getBoundingClientRect()`).
  - **DOM manipulation**: Making changes that will affect the layout or style of the page before the user sees any visual updates.
  - **Synchronous animations**: If you need to trigger animations immediately after a render and before the user sees it.
- **Performance**: Because `useLayoutEffect` runs synchronously, it can block the rendering process and may cause performance issues if overused, especially if it does heavy computation or DOM manipulations.

```javascript
useLayoutEffect(() => {
  // Example: Measuring the DOM element before render
  const height = ref.current.offsetHeight;
  console.log("Element height:", height);
}, []); // Empty dependency array means this runs once after the initial render
```

### **Summary of Differences**:

| Feature                | `useEffect`                              | `useLayoutEffect`                           |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **When it runs**       | After the render, after painting (async) | Before the paint (sync)                     |
| **Use case**           | Non-blocking tasks (e.g., fetching data) | Layout/DOM mutations, synchronous changes   |
| **Performance impact** | Doesn’t block rendering                  | Can block rendering, may impact performance |
| **Common tasks**       | Fetching data, event listeners           | Measuring DOM, layout adjustments           |

### **When to Use Each**:

- **Use `useEffect`**:  
  For side effects that don’t require blocking the DOM update. Most common use cases like data fetching, logging, or setting up event listeners should use `useEffect`.
- **Use `useLayoutEffect`**:  
  For cases where you need to make DOM manipulations, measure elements, or perform actions that must happen **before** the browser paints, especially when you need to avoid layout flickers or incorrect measurements.

### **Conclusion**:

- **`useEffect`** should be the default choice for side effects in React because it’s non-blocking and won't negatively affect user experience.
- **`useLayoutEffect`** should be used only when you need to ensure DOM mutations or measurements are done synchronously before the browser renders the updates to the screen.
