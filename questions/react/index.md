Sure! Here’s a list of React-focused questions to test your knowledge:

### React Interview Questions:

1. **How do you manage state in React, and what are the trade-offs between using Context API, Redux, and the built-in `useState`/`useReducer` hooks?**
2. **What are React's lifecycle methods, and how do you manage side effects in functional components using `useEffect`?**
3. **What is the difference between `useEffect` and `useLayoutEffect`? When would you use each one?**
4. **Explain the concept of "lifting state up" in React. How does it help in managing state across components?**
5. **What are controlled and uncontrolled components in React? When should you use each?**
6. **What is the Virtual DOM, and how does React optimize rendering with it?**
7. **How do you optimize React application performance?**
8. **What are higher-order components (HOCs) in React, and when would you use them?**
9. **What is React's Context API, and when would you use it over traditional prop drilling or Redux?**
10. **How does React handle event delegation and synthetic events?**
11. **Explain the concept of "React hooks" and give examples of custom hooks.**
12. **What is the difference between `React.memo` and `PureComponent`?**

**How do you handle error boundaries in React? Why are they important?**
18. **What are the key differences between React's `useRef` and `useState` hooks?**
19. **How does React handle keys in lists, and why are they important for performance and correct rendering?**
20. **What is server-side rendering (SSR) in React, and what are the benefits and trade-offs of using it?**
21. **What are some common pitfalls when working with React, and how would you avoid them?**
22. **Explain React’s reconciliation algorithm and how it helps with efficient rendering.**
23. **What is React’s Context API, and how does it help with prop drilling and state management in large applications?**
24. **How do you manage dependencies in the `useEffect` hook?**
25. **What is the significance of keys in lists and how do they help React with performance optimization?**
