### **What is Pooling in Databases?**  
**Database pooling** refers to the technique of maintaining a cache of reusable database connections instead of creating and closing a new connection for every request. This improves performance, reduces latency, and prevents resource exhaustion.

### **How It Works**  
1. **Connection Request** â†’ When an application needs to access the database, it requests a connection from the pool instead of creating a new one.  
2. **Connection Reuse** â†’ If an idle connection is available, it is assigned to the request. Otherwise, a new connection is created (up to a predefined limit).  
3. **Connection Release** â†’ After executing the query, the connection is returned to the pool instead of being closed.  
4. **Connection Cleanup** â†’ The pool manages idle connections and may close unused ones to free up resources.  

### **Benefits of Connection Pooling**
âœ… **Improved Performance** â€“ Reduces the overhead of repeatedly establishing new connections.  
âœ… **Efficient Resource Utilization** â€“ Prevents the database from being overwhelmed with excessive connections.  
âœ… **Lower Latency** â€“ Reusing connections makes queries execute faster.  
âœ… **Better Scalability** â€“ Helps handle high concurrency without exhausting database resources.  

### **Common Database Pooling Libraries**
- **Node.js (Express, NestJS)**: `pg-pool` (for PostgreSQL), `mysql2` (for MySQL), `mongoose` (MongoDB)  
- **Java**: HikariCP, C3P0  
- **Python**: SQLAlchemy Connection Pooling  
- **Go**: `database/sql` with connection pooling support
