# For lumel

## Where do you see yourself in 3â€“5 years?

In the next 3-5 years, I aim to evolve from my current backend development role into a technical architect position, leading the design of scalable distributed systems. I plan to deepen my expertise in cloud-native technologies and microservices architecture, while also developing my team leadership skills. A key goal is to architect systems that can handle millions of users while mentoring junior developers along the way. Most importantly, I want to build products that deliver genuine value to users and create meaningful impact â€“ whether that's solving real business challenges or improving people's daily lives. I believe in creating solutions that not only meet technical excellence but also empower both users and team members to achieve their goals.

### **Salary & Expectations Discussion**

#### **HR:** "You initially mentioned 9 LPA, but now you're asking for 12 LPA. Can you explain this change?"

**Your Response:**  
I understand the concern, and Iâ€™d like to clarify my reasoning. While my primary expertise is in **backend development**, I have also worked extensively as a **full-stack developer** in my previous organization. Iâ€™ve contributed to both **frontend and backend systems**, built SDKs, designed scalable APIs, and even worked on AI-driven services. Given this broader skill set, I believe my value extends beyond just a backend role.

Additionally, during my research on Lumel, I noticed that the company offers **around 10 LPA for freshers**. With **two years of industry experience** and a proven track record of delivering impactful solutions, I believe **12 LPA is a reasonable ask** that aligns with my skill set and contributions.

My current CTC is **6.5 LPA**, and just **seven months ago, I received a 100% hike** based on my performance. This indicates that my company values my work and would likely continue rewarding me if they were in a more stable position. Given my expertise, I am confident that my market value reflects this progression.

While I do have an offer for **9.5 LPA from a service-based company**, my preference remains **Lumel** because Iâ€™ve spent over a week researching your company and genuinely resonate with its vision and technical challenges. My decision is based on long-term **growth, impactful work, and alignment with the companyâ€™s culture** rather than just immediate compensation.
